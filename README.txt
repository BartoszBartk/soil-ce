This is the repository for code and pretest data used for a discrete choice experiment into public preferences for soil-based ecosystem services. You'll find the raw data from the pretest and the main study (cleaned, design and results separately) in the folder Data, the experimental design (output and Ngene script) in the folder Design and R scripts for the analysis of the data in the folder Scripts. The full dataset from the main study can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.20387/bonares-77fb-p034
The study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the funding measure “Soil as a Sustainable Resource for the Bioeconomy – BonaRes”, project “BonaRes (Module B): BonaRes Centre for Soil Research, subproject A” (grant 031B0511A).
