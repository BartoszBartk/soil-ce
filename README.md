# Economic valuation of soil-based ecosystem services
This is the repository for code and (part of the) data used for the analysis of a discrete choice experiment into public preferences for soil-based ecosystem services. You'll find the raw data from the pretest and the main study (cleaned, design and results separately) in the folder Data, the experimental design (output and Ngene script) in the folder Design and R scripts for the analysis of the data in the folder Scripts. The full dataset from the main study can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.20387/bonares-77fb-p034 There's also an open-access data publication that describes the dataset: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108371

The code (and accompanying data) includes two different analysis steps: one, associated with a Q Open publication (https://doi.org/10.1093/qopen/qoac035), is a more general analysis using only (a part of) the survey data and relies on mixed logit models; the other combines individual WTP estimates with spatial data for a spatial heterogeneity analysis (Soil Security publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soisec.2023.100120).

In addition, there is a Folder "BonaRes_test_case", which contains a script for the evaluation of modelling scenarios from the BODIUM soil model using recalculated WTPs from the above DCE and KTBL data on costs and prices of agricultural production.

The study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the framework of the funding measure “Soil as a Sustainable Resource for the Bioeconomy – BonaRes”, project “BonaRes (Module B): BonaRes Centre for Soil Research, subproject A” (grant 031B0511A). The contact person reponsible for all the errors is Bartosz Bartkowski (bartosz.bartkowski@ufz.de) at Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ in Leipzig, Germany.
